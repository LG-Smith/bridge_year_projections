To run or update projections:

Run script 01pull_and_clean_data.R
- uses ROracle to pull data from CAMS tables. Establishes the oracle connection using a function particular to GARFO/APSD, which uses the keyring package so that our internal scripts are more interchangeable between users. Outside users may need to establish the connection differently.
- formats data and saves the results in "output" folder.
- data are potentially confidential at this level (daily landings/discard estimates), and are therefore not saved to the github.

Render to CY25_bridge_year_projections.qmd file
- this runs the projections for each stock/sub-component from the data in 'output' folder
- Creates HTML file with interactive table and plots for each stock and sub-component


Additional Info:
R folder
- contains functions used in projections, currently just the "simple_projection_fnc.R", which scales the previous years data by the mean change from previous year to current year over a user-defined period.

Analysis folder
- Other scripts not used directly in making final projections- exploratory data analysis, etc.


** notes for development:
- Turn pull_and_clean_data script into a function with arguments for which years of data to pull and which species (hard-coded in SQL right now)
- Change projections to be on the daily timestep and then aggregate to week to get rid of the little gap between known catch and projections in plots
- add option for bootstrapping to the simple projections function
